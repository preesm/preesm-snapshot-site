         PREESM (the Parallel and Real-time Embedded Executives Scheduling Method)
      is an open source rapid prototyping and code generation tool. It
      is primarily employed to simulate signal processing applications
      and generate code for multi-core Digital Signal Processors. PREESM
      is developed at the Institute of Electronics and
      Telecommunications-Rennes (IETR) in collaboration with Texas
      Instruments France in Nice.
